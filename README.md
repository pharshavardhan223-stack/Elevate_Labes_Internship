# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)





---



## Project Overview:

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset used for analytical learning and survival prediction studies.  

The goal is to explore, clean, and visualize data to understand relationships, identify patterns, and extract actionable insights.

## Datasets Used:





| File Name | Description |

|------------|-------------|

| `train.csv` | Passenger details with survival information |

| `test.csv` | Passenger details without survival labels |

| `gender\_submission.csv` | Sample survival predictions for the test data |

## Tools \& Libraries:





\- Platform: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

\- Languages \& Libraries:

&nbsp; - `pandas` ‚Üí Data manipulation  

&nbsp; - `matplotlib` ‚Üí Basic plotting  

&nbsp; - `seaborn` ‚Üí Advanced visualizations

## EDA Workflow:





1.Basic Data Exploration  

Used `.describe()`, `.info()`, and `.value\_counts()` to understand dataset shape, data types, and statistical summaries.



2.Data Visualization  

Created correlation visuals using:

\- `sns.pairplot()` ‚Üí pairwise relationships  

\- `sns.heatmap()` ‚Üí correlation matrix



3.Relationship \& Trend Analysis  

Explored patterns between survival rate and key attributes such as:

\- Gender (`Sex`)

\- Class (`Pclass`)

\- Age and Fare



4.Univariate \& Bivariate Visuals  

Used:

\- Histograms to study distributions  

\- Boxplots to compare continuous features  

\- Scatterplots to observe variable relationships



5.Observations  

Added insights and remarks after each major visualization for clear interpretation.



6.Summary of Findings  

Compiled all patterns and takeaways into a structured summary for presentation and reporting.

## Key Insights





| Insight | Description |

|----------|-------------|

| üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Gender | Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males |

| üõ≥Ô∏è Class | 1st-class passengers were more likely to survive than 3rd-class |

| üë∂ Age | Younger passengers (especially children) had higher survival chances |

| üí∞ Fare | Higher fare correlated positively with survival probability |

| üìà Trend | Most passengers were aged between 20‚Äì40 years |

## How to Run the Notebook:





1\. Open \[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.  

2\. Upload the three datasets: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender\_submission.csv`.  

3\. Run all cells sequentially.  

4\. The notebook will automatically generate visuals and insights.  

5\. Save and download the final output (`EDA\_Report.pdf` or processed CSVs).
